# Template
Open Stage Control, VEP, Cubase - template version manager

kind of messy right now,

- template.json is my Open Stage Control template, settings, buttons, etc.
- template.js is a "custom module" that can be loaded into Open Stage Control
- tracks.json is a list of names, parameters, etc. for the orchestral instrument tracks I use in Cubase. this is viewed in Open Stage Control with help from the custom module.
